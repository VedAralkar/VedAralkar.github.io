## About Me

I'm a computer engineer and AI researcher passionate about reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and multimodal deep learning.
My work spans robotic manipulation, factual QA systems using LLMs and knowledge graphs, and real-world benchmarking of AI models.
I enjoy building intelligent systems that combine research innovation with practical impact.

## Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Model Free/Model Based Algorithms, Exploration-Exploitation, Robotics
- **Deep Learning:** Multi-Model Deep Learning, Small Language Models, Unsupervised Learning (GANs, VAEs)
